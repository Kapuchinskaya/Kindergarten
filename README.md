# Kindergarten
Kindergarten Website

A website for a kindergarten created to practice:

* ReactJS
* Firebase (_note: as the base was created in testing mode, it is not available now. All the data except parents' responses is now in Resources folder_)
* Libraries (material-ui, react-scroll, react-slick, react-toastify etc.)
 
and much more!

_note: media queries are not finished_
